      to a court order or a subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet national security or law enforcement
      requirements).
      <br><br>
      <b>&nbsp;Vital Interests:</b> We may disclose your information where we believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action
      regarding potential violations of our policies, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the safety of any
      person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in which we are involved.
      <br><br>
      More specifically, we may need to process your data or share your personal information in the following

      <h2 id="sociallogins">4. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h2>
      <b>In Short:</b> If you choose to register or log in to our services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.
      <br><br>
      Our Website offers you the ability to register and login using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will
      receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile Information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends
      list, profile picture as well as other information you choose to make public on such social media platform.
      <br><br>
      We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or
      that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Website.
      Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review
      their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.
      <h2 id="intltransfers">5. IS YOUR INFORMATION TRANSFERRED INTERNATIONALLY?</h2>
      <b>In Short:</b> We may transfer, store, and process your information in countries other than your own.
      <br><br>
      Our servers are located in the United States. If you are accessing our Website from outside the United States,
      please be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored, and processed by us in our facilities
      and by those third parties with whom we may share your personal information (see "<a href="#infoshare">WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH ANYONE?</a>" above), in
      the United States and other
      countries.
      <br><br>
      If you are a resident in the European Economic Area we will take all necessary measures to protect your personal information in accordance with this privacy notice and
      applicable law.
      <h2 id="inforetain">6. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
      <b>In Short:</b> We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.
      <br><br>
      We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in
      this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting or other legal requirements).
      No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than 90 days.
      When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or
      anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives),
      then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until
      deletion is possible.
      <h2 id="infosafe">7. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
      <b>In Short:</b> We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.
      <br><br>
      We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any
      personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over
      the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot
      promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to
      protect
      your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our
      Website is at your own risk. You should only access the
      Website within a secure environment.

      you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the
      Website. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such
      data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at
      privacy@husker.beer.

      personal information, you also have the right to complain to your local data protection supervisory authority.
      You can find their contact details here: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm</a>.

      <h2 id="DNT">10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
      Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”)
      feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing
      DNT
      signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that
      we
      must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.
